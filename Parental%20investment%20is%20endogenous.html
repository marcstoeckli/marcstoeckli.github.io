<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><p style="background-color:#ffffcc;">This is a seedling note. The content is subject to major and frequent revisions (see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="From%2520seedling%2520to%2520evergreen.html">From seedling to evergreen</a>).</p></p><p>It comes as no surprise that investments by parents into their children – be it quality time or financial resources – are important for the children's success in life (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="There%2520is%2520a%2520large%2520SES%2520gap%2520in%2520parental%2520investment.html">There is a large SES gap in parental investment</a>). Studying the role of parental investments from an economic point of view is a messy business, however. The supply of investments, and the distribution across siblings, is endogenously formed, thus posing a multitude of empirical issues (what, for me, makes it fun to work on this topic).</p><p><h3>Returns to investment</h3></p><p>For instance, precicesly estimating the returns to parental investment is notoriously difficult. Such an issue may arise if there is an unobserved variable that has a causal effect on both the supply of parental investment and the child's success. Think of a communicative child that asks his or her parents more-than-usual questions. This personality trait may evoke additional investments from the parent, e.g. quality time spent with the child. But the trait may also be an indicator of a highly curious and intelligent child, who receives high grades in school irrespective of inputs by his or her parents. In that case, regressing grades on parental investment would overestimate the impact of investments of educational achievement as it also captures the pathway via the personality trait. As an extreme example, it is well possible that investments have no effect on grades at all, and the empirical correlation between the two is just the result of straight A students being exceptionally good at evoking parental investment (note that I see much empirical support for such an extreme case).</p><p>This is of course no news for economists – endogeneity issues are what we deal with on a regular basis. Unfortunately, the issue is not easy to solve empirically. Either one can explicitly control for the unobserved variables. In the example presented here, controlling for an intelligence or ability test such as the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test would be an option (although I am not a fan of the concept of intelligence tests), or controlling for the child's polygenic scores (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Genetics%2520research%2520matters%2520for%2520economics.html">Genetics research matters for economics</a>). If available, an alternative strategy would be to control for the lagged outcome variable. Or, naturally, one may employ an instrumental variable approach.</p><p><h3>Intra-household resource allocation</h3></p><p>Another issue are decisions concerning intra-household resource allocation, such as how much investment to supply, by whom (distribution across parents), or for whom (distribution across children). And then there is the dicision about whether to have children, at what time, and how many. What I am currently most interested in are the determinants governing the distribution of investment across siblings. </p><p>Broadly, this is captured in the discussion about birth order effects, showing that the order in which a child is born is relevant for future life outcomes (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="A%2520primer%2520on%2520the%2520birth%2520order%2520effect.html">A primer on the birth order effect</a>). Think of the middle child that has to share his or her parents during the full childhood period. Yet another relevant aspect is one's siblings characteristics, above and beyond the fact that they are younger or older. Take the example of a communicative child again (or, to highlight the point more clearly, one can also think of a trouble-maker instead). Having a brother or sister with a trait that invokes the attention by the parents has an impact on one's amount of parental investment – a child may steal the quality time from his or her siblings. Another example is differences in endowments across siblings, such as differential skill levels. The literature on this is rather scarce, but suggests that parents tend to reinforce skill differences by supplying relative more inputs to the better-endowed child (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Parents%2520tend%2520to%2520reinforce%2520endowment%2520differences%2520of%2520their%2520children.html">Parents tend to reinforce endowment differences of their children</a>; I have my reservations with these findings, however). </p></div>
