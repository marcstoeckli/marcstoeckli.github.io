<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><p style="background-color:#ffffcc;">This is a seedling note. The content is subject to major and frequent revisions.</p></p><p>The individual working notes on this website are connected with <strong>bi-directional links</strong>. Each connected note contains a link back to the source, but also to every other note that it is connected with (see &quot;References&quot; below). The result is a web of thoughts where related notes have close ties. This may sound like a minor feature, but it has the potential to fundamentally change how we deal with knowledge management (and at least for me, bi-directional links have been a game-changer).</p><p>Most people I know (and most note-taking apps) rely on a <strong>hierarchical folder system</strong>, where each note belongs to a specific branch within a tree system (does &quot;Dropbox &gt; My Projects &gt; Project A &gt; Meetings &gt; Notes_20200901.docx&quot; sound familiar?). This is of course better than nothing, especially better than having no system at all. And some information is inherently well-suited for such a structure, e.g. reference material. In fact, I partly still rely on hierarchical systems, most notably the <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/" target="_blank">PARA</a> approach. But the issue is that <strong>the individual notes are rigid and non-connected</strong>. By rigid I mean that once they are placed within a folder or branch, related notes need to follow the same hierarchy in order to create connections (think of &quot;... &gt; Meetings &gt; Notes_20200902.docx&quot;). This creates two problems. For one, it requires thinking about the structure too early. When I start thinking about a new research project, it may be detrimental to already put a box around the thinking process. And second, I may have made a mistake in the initial hierarchy and would like to make changes later on. At least in my experience, this is a cumbersome task.</p><p>Using a series of <strong>tags</strong> (e.g. #projectA vs. #projectB to distinguish two projects) may be a remedy for the second issue, but it may lead to a constant adjusting of tags. And it also doesn't solve the second major problem, i.e. that notes are either non-connected, or have to be connected a priori by the note-taker. Again, this is better than nothing, but there are far-reaching downsides with this approach. Importantly, and related to the rigidity issue, <strong>the connections need to be known too early</strong> (in some cases). And again, creating connections later on is a cumbersome task.</p><p>Notes connected with bi-directional links <strong>don't require such a priori knowledge</strong>. Instead, the links themselves ensure that connections emerge organically over time. Whenever a note links to another one, a new backlink is created, and a web of thoughts emerges. This enables the note-taker to fully focus on writing down his or her thought, as connectections can still be made later (literally years after). No need to think about a (hierarchical) structure at that point. As far as I can tell from my own experience, this is how the human thinking process works.</p><p>This process fabricates serendipity, enabling the possibility to discover previously unknown or unintended connections. As such, topics that seem unrelated at first hand may suddenly appear to relate to each other. To me this feels a lot like what we mean by creative thinking – finding patterns where they are not obvious. For me as an academic researcher, this is the true power of bi-directional links (and the reason why I'm using <a href="https://roamresearch.com" target="_blank">Roam Research</a>).</p></div>
