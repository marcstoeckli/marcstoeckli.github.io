<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><p style="background-color:#ffffcc;">This is a seedling note. The content is subject to major and frequent revisions (see <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="From%2520seedling%2520to%2520evergreen.html">From seedling to evergreen</a>).</p></p><p>In my experience discussing genetics research, there is an important misunderstanding about the political implications of genetic heritability. Importantly, from a trait being highly heritable does <em>not</em> follow determinism in the sense that individuals or policy-makers have no power to change outcomes. For instance, take bad eyesight. Even if having bad eyes were 100% heritable, i.e. all variation in the quality of eyesight between individuals were due to differences in their genomes, glasses would still be highly useful (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="Gene-environment%2520interactions%2520are%2520the%2520holy%2520grail%2520for%2520social%2520scientists.html">Gene-environment interactions are the holy grail for social scientists</a>). </p><h3 class="">Explained variance</h3><p>But more importantly, heritability is simply a measure of explained variance, similar to the concept of R<sup>2</sup>. What heritability tells us is what share of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the variation in the independent variables (genetic endowment vs. environment). Consider the constructed example where there is exactly one environmental variable that has an effect on an outcome of interest, e.g. nutrition on body height. Assuming that nutrition can take on two expressions (malnourished or not), and that nobody in the population is malnourished, <em>heritability of body height would be 100%</em>. This is simply due to the fact that the variation of nutrition is zero by construction. If there are only two variables that have an impact on the phenotype – the genetic endowment and the single environmental variable – then heritability has to be 100% by definition if there is no variation in the environment. </p><p>This of course does not mean that nutrition has no effect on body height. Quite the opposite is true, i.e. malnourishment would nonetheless lead to shorter body height. Heritability of 100% in this example just means that – <em>in this population</em> – genetic differences explains all of the variation in the phenotype.</p><h3 class="">Heritability and group differences</h3><p>A key point is that heritability is contingent on a particular population. That is, across different populations or groups, hertibality may vary (<a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="The%2520heritability%2520of%2520a%2520phenotype%2520is%2520not%2520constant%2520over%2520time.html">The heritability of a phenotype is not constant over time</a>). Extending the constructed example, assume there is a second population that is an exact copy of the first one in terms of genetic endowment (i.e. everyone in population one has an identical twin in the second population), but that differs in terms of nourishment. Specifically, assume that half of population two is malnourished. As a result, one observes differential height distributions between the two populations, where population one will be taller on average (since malnourishment has a negative effect on body height). However, heritability of body height would fall short well below 100% in the second population, as there is non-zero variation in the environmental variable. </p><p>Note that there is no bias involved in the sense that one heritability is more correct than the other. Both of them are correct, as the concept refers to a particular population. This implies that inferences from heritability in the first to the second population are difficult to make. Importantly, one cannot infer that group differences are due to differences in the genetic endowment, as a naive understanding of the 100% heritability in the first population might suggest. Rather, group differences in the constructed example are due to differences in the environments.</p></div>
