<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p><p style="background-color:#ffffcc;">This is a seedling note. The content is subject to major and frequent revisions.</p></p><p>This website is what has been called a &quot;digital garden&quot; (for example <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden" target="_blank">here</a>, or <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2020/05/digital-gardening/" target="_blank">here</a>). To borrow the terminology from gardening, each note starts its journey as a &quot;seedling&quot;. Seedlings are rough and potentially unstructured, albeit not random (quite the opposite, actually – they are usually based on a large number of fleeting notes that I took over several weeks). Importantly, they are subject to major, and oftentimes frequent, revisions (the &quot;weeding&quot;). Over time, the note developes, takes on a more structured form, until it finally becomes an &quot;evergreen&quot; (or gets deleted). Although there is no clear-cut definition for when a note has matured enough, evergreen status indicates that I am confident(-ish) with its content and the information it conveys.</p><p>The methaphor of a garden emphasizes that the focus of my working notes is less about showing a final result, but rather on the process and development of a thought process. At every state of this process, you are explicitly encouraged to provide feedback. In an ideal world, most of the revisions of seedlings are due to remarks and feedback that I have received. If you want to get in touch with me, you can reach me via my academic <a href="http://marcstoeckli.net/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p><p>A digital garden is fundmentally different than a personal blog. Importantly, the notes are to a large degree aimed at myself and may therefore be not self-containing at times (although I write them with a reader in mind). Then, as mentioned, they undergo a transformation from rough scribbles to well-structured text. Apart from the time stamp, revisions or updates are neither recorded nor mentioned; this means that the content and my statements may be different every time you visit the website, with no prior warning (so don't cite my notes!). As a result, the chronological order loses its meaning, where the most recent note isn't necessarily the one I want you to read immediately. <a href="https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/" target="_blank">Amy Hoy</a> has an interesting view on this.</p><p>And finally, I am more sloppy in terms of citations than what is the standard in academia. That is, I don't claim originality for every sentence that I write here; after all, this is not an outlet for publications, but for working notes. If I end up publishing some of them, the citations will be added accordingly.</p></div>
